Warrick Dunn, a three-time Pro Bowl selection (1997, 2000 and 2005), Dunn played his first five seasons with Tampa Bay (1997-2001) before playing six seasons with the Atlanta Falcons (2002-2007), returning to Tampa in 2008. He is an elusive, electrifying back who possesses exceptional game-breaking speed and quickness and serves as a dual threat as a runner and receiver. Dunn is one of 23 running backs in NFL history to gain over 10,000 career rushing yards (10,967), has rushed for over 1,000 yards in a single season five times (1998, 2000, 2004, 2005 and 2006) and has had 30 games of 100 rushing yards or more. Dunn is the only active running back in the league to have recorded over 10,000 rushing yards and 4,000 receiving yards.

Since 1997, Warrick Dunn has been touching the hearts of single parents — in Tampa, Baton Rouge, Atlanta and Tallahassee. The Warrick Dunn Foundation and his Homes for the Holidays program has maintained the goal of keeping his late mother’s dream of home ownership alive by assisting hard working single parents in owning their first home. Dunn provides additional cash towards a down payment on a house and then surprises the new owner by furnishing the house with everything a first-time homeowner would need including: furniture, food, linens, gardening supplies, washer, dryer, dishes, pots and pans, toothbrushes, etc. He is also involved with Athletes for Hope, Boy Scouts and Hurricane Katrina Relief.
