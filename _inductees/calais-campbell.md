Campbell is in his 11th year in the NFL and serves as a captain for the Jaguarsâ€™ top-ranked defense. In addition to being named an Associated Press first-team All-Pro selection in 2017, winning the NFL 101 Awards AFC Defensive Player of the Year and being selected to three Pro Bowls, Calais lists his work in the community as his most cherished achievement during his tenure in the NFL.

Campbell runs the CRC Foundation, named after his late father, Charles Richard Campbell, which is committed to enhancing the community through the teaching of critical life skills to young people. Through sports, creative talents, vocational skills, financial skills, and quality health and nutrition, the CRC Foundation helps develop young people into empowered and self-aware leaders for the future.
