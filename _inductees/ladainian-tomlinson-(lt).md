LaDainian Tomlinson or “LT,” as he is known by his legion of fans around the world, had a season for the ages in 2006 as he set NFL records with 31 total touchdowns and 28 rushing touchdowns. His outstanding season was capped off in January when the NFL bestowed two of its highest honors upon LT, selecting him as its Most Valuable Player and its Man of the Year.

Tomlinson and his wife, LaTorsha, have teamed up to become community leaders in both San Diego and their native Texas. Together, they oversee the Tomlinson Touching Lives Foundation. The foundation hosts events throughout the year, including youth football camps in San Diego and Texas, a golf tournament, a fishing trip for kids from The Monarch School for homeless and at-risk teens in San Diego, a Thanksgiving program in which they provide more than 1,000 San Diego families with complete holiday dinners and a Christmas program in which they give away more than 1,500 holiday gifts to the patients at San Diego’s Children’s Hospital and Health Center. At each Chargers’ home game, LT hosts “The 21 Club,” where he invites 21 kids from San Diego youth groups and nonprofit organizations to attend a game. After the game, LT invites the children down to the field where they get a one-on-one visit with their football hero and a chance to pose for pictures. Each member of “The 21 Club” is sent home with a goody bag that is filled with school supplies, books and games. Another important branch of the Touching Lives Foundation is the “School is Cool Scholarship Fund,” which awards 30 annual scholarships to college-bound students based on academics, community involvement and volunteerism.
