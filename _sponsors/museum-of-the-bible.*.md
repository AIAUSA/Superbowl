desc: "For centuries, people have turned to the Bible for comfort, instruction, inspiration, and hope. But what about adventure, intrigue, entertainment, and FUN? Museum of the Bible invites you to experience the Bible in a whole new way. Inside, you can walk on dry land through the Red Sea, wander the streets of a first-century village, and see rare artifacts from the Vatican and Israel. Located just a few blocks off the National Mall in Washington, DC, we invite you to come see for yourself. Whatâ€™s in it will surprise you!"
