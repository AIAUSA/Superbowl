**TAMPA, Florida, January 5, 2020** - New Orleans Saints’ linebacker, Demario Davis, has been chosen by fellow NFL players to receive the 2021 Bart Star Award for exemplifying outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. It is the only award—other than the Pro Bowl—voted on by all NFL players.

The award, bearing the name of NFL Hall of Famer, Bart Starr, honors Starr’s lifelong commitment to serving as a positive role model to his family, teammates and community. Past winners of the award include Eli Manning, Calais Campbell, Benjamin Watson, Peyton Manning, Troy Vincent, Drew Brees, Derrick Brooks and Anthony Muñoz.

While leading the Saints in tackles on the field, off the field Davis tackles challenges in life with equal fervor. Davis is known by his peers for his commitment to community service and social justice. In 2020, Davis helped launch the #SayHerName campaign to raise awareness of issues facing black women in America. His Devoted Dreamers project equips “the next generation of leaders with the tools to be successful, spiritually, mentally, and physically.”

_“Football is what I do, not who I am,” said Davis. “I can’t afford to just play football and ignore the issues around me. I want to use my influence to help people and inspire others to do the same.”_

And inspire he has. In 2020, Davis actively demonstrated his unwaivering faith as his family faced a very personal battle: doctors discovered Davis’ young daughter had a rare form of eye cancer known as retinoblastoma and had to remove her left eye. Cancer free as of December, Davis believes his daughter’s trial provided the opportunity for his family to encounter and encourage others throughout their journey.

_“Davis’ life embodies Bart Starr’s incredible legacy of kindness, humility, charity and compassion. We are thrilled to honor him in this way,” said Terry Bortz, Super Bowl Breakfast Director._

Tony Dungy, Bart Starr Jr. and Cherry Starr will present the Bart Starr Award to Davis during the 34th annual Super Bowl Breakfast. Due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s breakfast will air as a special broadcast on Facebook Live, CTN and the Armed Forces Network. The event will be emceed by Akbar Gbajabiamila, co-host of American Ninja Warrior. Other program participants will include football greats, Anthony Munoz, Chad Hennings, Rocky Bleier, Benjamin Watson, Frank Reich and James Brown.
