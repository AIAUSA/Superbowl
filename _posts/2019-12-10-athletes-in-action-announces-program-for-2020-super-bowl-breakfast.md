**Hollywood, Florida** – **December 10, 2019** -- Athletes in Action (AIA) officially announced its 2020 Super Bowl Breakfast program that will serve the greater Miami area on **Saturday, Feb. 1 from 8-10 a.m.** with a community-wide, **NFL-sanctioned event** at the Diplomat Hotel in Hollywood, FL. Now in its 33rd year, the NFL-sanctioned event is projected to attract nearly 1,700 business executives.

“We have an exciting program planned for South Florida, including some very notable speakers and special guests,” said **Terry Bortz**, AIA Special Projects Director.

According to Bortz, **Akbar Gbajabiamila,** Co-host of American Ninja Warrior and NFL Network Analyst will emcee the event. This year’s program will honor the life and legacy of NFL legend, Bart Starr. **Tony Dungy**, Super Bowl Champion Coach and Pro Football Hall of Famer, will attend the breakfast along with members of Bart Starr’s family – his wife, Cherry Starr and son, Bart Starr Jr. Past Bart Starr Award winners and other NFL greats who playes with Bart will be on hand.

Attendees will hear narratives of faith and football from NFL players past and present, as well as witness the presentation of the **2020 The Bart Starr Award**. **The Bart Starr Award** is given annually to a player who represents exemplary character and leadership on and off the field.

The winner of the **Bart Starr Award** is determined by NFL-player balloting, making it one of only two individual honors selected by the players themselves. Players will be voting in mid-December and AIA will announce the winner the first week of January. Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end, Calais Campbell, won the **2019 Bart Starr Award.**
