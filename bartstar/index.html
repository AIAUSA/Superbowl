			<h3>Bart Starr Award</h3>
			<p>The Athletes in Action/<strong><span class="highlight">Bart Starr Award</span></strong> was created to honor the NFL player who best  exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. The Award is named after Bart Starr who, in addition to being in the NFL Hall of Fame, was   selected as MVP in Super Bowls I and II. Mr. Starr is an individual of impeccable character who has served his family and community faithfully through the years and is a role model for athletes and business people alike.</p>
      <p>Nominees are gathered from the Public Relations Directors of each NFL team, the past winners of the Bart Starr Award, the Athletes in Action Pro Staff working with NFL teams and Bart Starr. Ballots are sent to each team and voting takes place at the same time as the Pro Bowl selections. The votes are tabulated and the winner is announced at the annual Super Bowl Breakfast.</p>
      <p>In 1988, Athletes in Action held its inaugural Super Bowl Breakfast at Super Bowl XXII in San Diego, CA. In 1989, the first Bart Starr Award was presented at the Super Bowl Breakfast. Bart Starr agreed to partner with Athletes in Action to present this award in his name. He is present each year at the Breakfast to personally present the Award to the winner voted on by NFL players.</p>

							<h6>Benjamin Watson</h6>
              <p><strong><span class="highlight">Benjamin Watson</span></strong> of the Baltimore Ravens is the winner of the 2018 Bart Starr Award for outstanding character, integrity and leadership on and off the field. Watson was selected by his peers in the NFL, making this the only award voted on by all the players other than the Pro Bowl.
              Watson played college football at the University of Georgia and was drafted by the New England Patriots 32nd overall in the 2004 NFL draft. He also played for the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints. In his 12th year in the NFL, Watson had career bests in receptions (74) and yards (825), and tied his career high in touchdowns (six). On March 9, 2016, Benjamin Watson signed a two-year deal with the Baltimore Ravens.
              As a Patriot, Benjamin received a Super Bowl ring in his rookie season, and he appeared in Super Bowl XXXIX in 2007 with the New Orleans Saints.
              Off the field, Benjamin stays busy with his foundation One More. Since its inception, his desire has been for One More to be a vehicle to carry the hope and love of Christ to those in his community who need it most, while understanding that the best and most efficient way to reach their hearts is by first meeting their physical needs.
              “Our mission is to simply be a blessing to those around us wherever we are, whether that’s supporting existing charities or initiating programs of our own,” Watson says.
              He is also active in the anti-trafficking movement. Hello Beautiful was created to give girls a safe space to discuss the real issues they face, while giving them a godly perspective and truth on those issues. Topics such as self-esteem, body image, the dangers of technology, relationships with boys and girls, and sex are openly discussed, and no questions or discussion are off limits.
              Watson serves on the Executive Committee of the NFL Players Association and is an NFL spokesman for the All Pro Dad Campaign.
              In 2015, Watson published his first book, “Under Our Skin: Getting Real About Race- And Getting Free from The Fears and Frustrations That Divide Us.”  In October of 2016, he authored a “Group Conversation Guide” to aid the reader’s journey to honest conversation about race, bias and justice in America. On May 2, 2017, Watson released “The New Dad’s Playbook: Gearing Up for the Biggest Game of Your Life.”
              Watson and his wife, Kirsten and their five children will be transitioning back to New Orleans where he will play for the Saints again.</p>

							<h6>Matthew Slater</h6>
							<p>The New England Patriots probably didn’t know what a treasure they were signing when they chose <strong><span class="highlight">Matthew Slater</span></strong> with the 153rd pick of the 2008 NFL Draft, but it’s a decision they haven’t likely regretted. For the past six seasons, Slater’s teammates have elected him captain of special teams where his stellar performance has named him to the Pro Bowl each year.
                Slater has been a leader and a positive example to his team both on and off the field. After every game, win or lose, he leads his team in prayer as the stands empty and the lights go down. His teammates admire his poise and professionalism as well as his humble adherence to his faith, striving to be like him as both a football player and a man.
                He is highly involved in the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation, partnering with many organizations such as Play 60, Make-A-Wish, and Read between the Lines. Slater received the Ron Burton Community Service Award in 2016 for his dedication to the community of New England; he looks at football as a vehicle God has given him to reach people. He recruited some of his fellow Patriots to attend his “Matthew vs. Matthew” charity event this past October, a dinner and raffle to benefit Samaritan’s Purse in their relief efforts following Hurricane Matthew.
                Slater’s father, Jackie Slater, received the Bart Starr Award in 1996, making the Slaters the first father-son duo to ever win the award. Growing up, Matthew Slater’s mother would drop him and his brother at church on Sundays and pick them up a bit early to watch his father’s NFL games. Slater certainly had a wonderful example of leadership and character to look up to in his childhood that paved the way for his later success.
                Slater and his wife, Shahrzad, have a one-year-old son, Jeremiah.

							<h6>Thomas Davis</h6>
							<p>In his 11-year career with the Carolina Panthers, <strong><span class="highlight">Thomas Davis</span></strong> has made a massive impact, both on and off the field. A five-year team captain, in 2012 Davis became the first known NFL player to return for a full season after three ACL reconstructions on the same knee; and in the last three years, he’s played some of the best football of his career.
                Selected as the 14th overall pick in the 2005 NFL draft from the University of Georgia, Davis puts his shoulder into as many charities as he does enemy ball carriers. In 2008, Davis and his wife, Kelly, started the Thomas Davis Defending Dreams Foundation (TDDDF), a nonprofit dedicated to providing and promoting free programs that enhance the quality of life for more than 2,000 underprivileged children and their families annually. Since its inception, the foundation has distributed more than $500,000 in aid. Based on the principles of educate/empower/defend, the foundation’s cornerstone program is the Youth Leadership Academy, a 14-week after-school mentoring program for low-income middle school students. The academy emphasizes areas like etiquette, public speaking, leadership and community involvement.
                The Defending Dreams Foundation provides a variety of other programs free to participants. The annual youth football camp serves over 350 young boys and girls and emphasizes the importance of a healthy diet and exercise in addition to teaching proper football fundamentals.  To kick off the school year, the foundation hosts an annual back-to-school supply giveaway, providing over 600 supply-filled backpacks to low-income students. Every November, Davis takes his teammates to a local restaurant to serve clients of the Battered Women’s Shelter a hot Thanksgiving meal. TDDDF also holds an annual Christmas giveaway, distributing presents in communities throughout the Carolinas and Davis’s hometown in Georgia.
                In addition to the personal time and commitment he gives to his foundation’s programs and fundraising efforts, Thomas is also actively involved with the American Heart Association’s Mid-Atlantic Chapter, the Second Harvest Food Bank, Levine Children’s Hospital and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
                In April of 2014, Davis received the Call to Courage Award, given annually to a Christian athlete who displays exemplary character through both adversity and triumph. Davis was also recognized in 2014 as the  Walter Payton Man of the Year.
